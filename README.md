## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Tried implementing vanilla JavaScript for the first time. Learned quite a lot of basics and syntax from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript).

### Continued development

Continue learning JavaScript to optimize code and make it neater. CSS can be a bit better and follow DRY.

### Useful resources

- [Learn JavaScript](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) - This helped me to learn JavaScript. Very easy to follow and purposeful exercises.
